                            You don't follow the action, you <span id="italic">initiate</span> it! You frequently find yourself on dangerous adventures with your best friend. You may not always be the hero, but you enjoy taking the credit for it regardless. Life just isn't moving fast enough otherwise. Your friends and family mean the <span id="italic">galaxy</span> to you, and you'll fight for them for as long as you can. Your favorite leisure activity is a nice game of dejarik, which you always win because nobody dares upset you.</p>

                        <p>You enjoy living in leisure, meandering along the path of least resistance. Some may say you’re <span id="italic">too</span> passive, but you prefer to think of yourself as a chameleon, adapting to whatever situation you find yourself in.
                            You can’t really be bothered by the trials of life, and you know that whatever will be will be! Those closest to you love your down-for-whatever energy and appreciate your chill disposition. When people ask you what your hobbies are, you tell them you “like to have a good time.”<br>
                            You are <span id="italic">really just vibin’.</span></p>

                            The archtypical Creative, you wouldn’t <span id="italic">necessarily</span> consider yourself an extravert, but rather someone who is “wisely assertive”.  You are willing to speak for the voiceless, to represent the under-represented, and to <q>"put yourself out there"</q> regardless of the consequences.</p>

                        <h3>Sherduck Holmes</h3>
                        <p>Insatiable curiosity, wide-ranging interests, and a keen analytical mind. However, he can be more focused on his thoughts than on those around him, coming across as distant or aloof to the casual observer. His closest associates know better, though, seeing behind the façade to the warm, engaging, and intensely loyal individual that the World never suspects is there.</p>
